 - 2% burn rate for every TX (stops at 50% of initial supply)

The governance rate is send to a wallet that can be used every 3 months by team for whatever the community votes for.

Above idea is what we can deploy short term and like to move forward with.

 - Securing imports and export payments. Smartcontract ensure buyer and seller are comfortable and having transparency. If one is not legit, the transcaction will be reversed.
 - Game industry: An app is created for users to hold the coins, which would be in a form of wallet. Using those coins, players can decide and have a say in the structure of the games, rules, governance etc etc.
A fantasy app which would run on blockchain.
